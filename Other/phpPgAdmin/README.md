# phpPgAdmin

phpPgAdmin is a fully functional web-based administration utility for a PostgreSQL database server, licensed under a free and open source license. Similar to phpMyAdmin, which phpPgAdmin was also based on, it is written in PHP and can be accessed with a web browser. PhpPgAdmin requires a web server with PHP, such as Apache or Nginx, and is therefore cross-platform.
